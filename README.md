## Hi! / Merhaba! / Bonjour ! / ¡Hola! ![peepoHey emote](peepoHey.gif)

I'm Furkan Kambay (he/him). I'm a 21-year-old community-taught developer who is fascinated by all technology. I care about writing clean and self-documenting code.

#### My interests

- General software development mainly in C#, Python, C++, and any other language required for the job
- Game dev in Unity and basic modeling in Blender — [Repos][unity-source-repos]
- Penetration testing & reverse engineering — [Hack The Box Profile][hack-the-box]
- Electronics (basic circuitry & MCU programming)

My competence in each of these fields is not the same. I aim to improve every day.

### Projects

I have previously written a couple of API wrapper libraries which you can find in [my repositories][source-repos].

Recently, I am very interested in game development and I try to work on some of my ideas when I have the time.
