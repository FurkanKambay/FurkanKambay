## Hi! / Merhaba! / Bonjour ! / Â¡Hola! ![peepoHey emote](peepoHey.gif)

I'm Furkan Kambay (he/him). I'm a 21-year-old community-taught developer who is fascinated by all technology. I care about writing clean and self-documenting code.

#### I am mostly interested in

- General software development in C#, Python, C++
- Game dev in Unity (code side and some basic modelling)
- Electronics (hardware and programming - Arduino, ESP8266)
- Basic modeling in Blender (sadly, I'm no artist)
- Pentesting & reverse engineering (mostly a beginner)

My competence in each of these fields is not the same. I am looking to improve every day.

### Hobbies

- Languages and translation. I am a native Turkish- and fluent English-speaker. I am learning French and Spanish. I am studying English translation and interpreting at university.
- I watch a lot of TV shows. Sci-fi and crime shows are among my favorites.
- I love listening to music. Hip hop, rock, EDM, chill... depending on the moment.

### Projects

I have previously wrote a couple of API wrapper libraries which you can find in [my repositories][source-repos].

Recently, I am very interested in game development and I hope to continue working on some of my ideas when I have more free time from university.
