## Hi! / Merhaba! / Bonjour ! / Â¡Hola! ![peepoHey emote](peepoHey.gif)

I'm Furkan Kambay (he/him). I'm a 21-year-old community-taught developer who is fascinated by all technology. I care about writing clean and self-documenting code.

#### My interests

- General software development in C#, Python, C++ (desktop apps, libraries, tools)
- Game dev in Unity
- Basic modeling in Blender
- Pentesting & reverse engineering (mostly a beginner looking to improve)
- Electronics (basic circuitry, Arduino & ESP8266 programming)

My competence in each of these fields is not the same. I am looking to improve every day.

### Projects

I have previously written a couple of API wrapper libraries which you can find in [my repositories][source-repos].

Recently, I am very interested in game development and I try to work on some of my ideas when I have the time.
