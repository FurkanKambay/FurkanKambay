## About me

I'm Furkan, a self-taught software developer. I care about writing clean code and I love learning new technologies and languages.

### My interests

- Software development in C#, Python, C++ (as well as other languages)
- Game development in Unity and basic modeling in Blender — [Unity Repos][unity-source-repos]
- Penetration testing & reverse engineering — [Hack The Box Profile][hack-the-box]
- Electronics (basic circuitry & MCU programming)

My competence in each of these fields is not the same. I aim to improve every day.

### Projects

I have previously written a couple of API wrapper libraries that you can find in [my repositories][source-repos].

Recently, I am very interested in game development and I try to work on my ideas when I have time. Currently, I am creating a realistic lockpicking mechanic in Unity.
